        I work with{" "}
        <span className="article-emphesise">JavaScript/TypeScript</span> as my
        primary programming languages. I&apos;ve also dabbled in other
        languages, such as Python, where I&apos;ve written some small scripts.
        During my computer science studies at TVZ, I gained a foundational
        understanding of programming in C, object-oriented programming in Java,
        and algorithms in C++. However, I wouldn&apos;t consider myself
        proficient in these languages at a professional level.

        Vanilla JavaScript is rarely used in today&apos;s web development
        landscape. Like most web developers, I&apos;ve opted for a framework, in
        my case,
        <span className="article-emphesise">React</span> . I began learning
        React when class-based components were the norm, and you can still find
        such code in my early GitHub repositories. Over time, I embraced{" "}
        <span className="article-emphesise">Next.js</span>, and it has become my
        primary tool for writing code outside of work.

        While I don&apos;t consider myself a designer, I much prefer translating
        finished designs in Figma into code rather than creating designs from

        portfolio and some of my projects are the result of my design efforts.
